The scope of mia.cx is considerably large, that's why I need to prioritize and figure out what to focus on first. If a freelance opportunity or commission-based work presents itself, and I can do it alongside business activities, I will take it.

## canvas

The initial focus will be on [[Projects/canvas/index|canvas]]. Before moving on to other projects, canvas should be public, and making enough revenue to support me personally. The road to get to that point is detailed below, or in [[Projects/canvas/index|canvas]]. After that milestone of being self-sustaining, I want to start working on other projects like [[Projects/Textile/index|Textile]].

## Textile

After canvas hits it self-sustaining milestone, I'll think about getting started on [[Projects/Textile/index|Textile]]. I've outlined below how that will get from start to launch.
