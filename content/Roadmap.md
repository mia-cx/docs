The scope of mia.cx is considerably large, that's why I need to prioritize and figure out what to focus on first. More detailed roadmaps will be available in respective [[Projects/index|Projects]] folders. If a freelance opportunity or commission-based work presents itself, and I can do it alongside business activities, I will take it.

The initial focus will be on [[Projects/canvas/index|canvas]]. Before moving on to other projects, canvas should be public, and making enough revenue to support me personally. The road to get to that point is detailed in the [[Projects/canvas/Roadmap|canvas Timeline]]. After that milestone of being self-sustaining, I want to start working on other projects like [[Projects/Textile/index|Textile]].

After the self-sustainability milestone of canvas, I'll get started on [[Projects/Textile/index|Textile]]. I've outline in the [[Projects/Textile/Roadmap|Textile Timeline]] how that will get from start to launch.
