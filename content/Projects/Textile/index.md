Textile is a productivity web app that lets everyone keep track of their tasks, schedule and productivity more clearly.

## The target audience

The working professional

## The problems

The concept for Textile was borne out of my own annoyance with project planning and time tracking.

When managing my time I found that some scenarios ask for simple to-do lists, others require time blocking schedules, and some benefit from roadmaps and kanban boards. But nothing I've found or used can switch between all these "planning modes", while keeping your tasks and knowledge base centralized.

I also make extensive use of pomodoro timers and time tracking to see how much time i actually spend working on each task, as well as how much time i spend working each day.

To effectively manage my time, and plan my projects, up until now I've had to switch between a number of different tools and manually keep everything synchronized myself, or with zapier.

The original idea was for Textile to be just that, a synchronization tool between other productivity tools I liked best, but over time, the realization set in that this should be its own platform with synchronization to other platforms being secondary.
